	Kubelet is like a captain on the ship, They lead all actvities on the ship. Kubelet is responsible for load and unload the container on the ship as instructed by the scheduler on the master. They also send back reports at regular intervels on the status of the ship and container on them. The kubelet in the kubernetes worker node register the node with kubernetes cluster. When it receives instruction to load a container or pod on the node, it requeists the container runtime engine wich maybe docker, to pull the required image and run on instance. The kubelet then continues to monitor the state of the pod and container init and reports to the Kube-API-Server on a timely basis.
